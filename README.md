# Rocket First Stage Landing Success Rate Prediction

## Background
SpaceX, a leader in the space industry, strives to make space travel affordable for everyone. Its accomplishments include sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, launching a satellite constellation that provides internet access, and sending manned missions to space. SpaceX can do this because the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive ($62 million per launch) due to its novel reuse of the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Other providers, which are not able to reuse the first stage, cost upwards of $165 million each. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used by the company to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Methodology
### Data collection
Data was collected using the SpaceX API and performing web scraping on Wikipedia.
### Performed data wrangling
Data was cleaned, unwanted data was removed, and nan values and categorical variables were taken care of.
### Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
### Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
### Performed predictive analysis using classification models
Built, tuned, and evaluated classification models

## Problems Answered
Determined whether the first will land successfully, what factors affect the landing, and how they interact with each other.
